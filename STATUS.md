# STATUS

Rolling change context for AbyssBSD. Kept short by design — see
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) §7. Older history is `git log`; the
plan is the roadmap.

## Epic

**Phase 4 — the broker and the FreeBSD IPC transport — is closed.** The
first FreeBSD-bearing phase, and the boundary the roadmap was ordered
around. Gate D (`docs/design/broker-and-transport.md`) is built and
proven in the VM: the broker reads its manifests, builds the authority
graph, launches each component into its jail in Capsicum capability
mode, supervises them, re-wires on restart, honours delegated spawn,
and composes with Casper.

- `crates/abyss-broker` — the broker. Its host slice: the `manifest`
  parser — the component-manifest schema and its fixed-schema declarative
  text format, a first-party parser with no vendored config crate, and
  `Manifest::load_dir`, reading a directory of them into a manifest set
  (`broker-and-transport.md` §4, §5.1) — and the `graph` module, the
  static authority graph computed and validated from a manifest set
  (§5.2), and the `catalogue` module, the interface catalogue (§3.3) with
  its on-disk form. And, on FreeBSD, the `spawn`, `session`, and `boot`
  modules — component spawn, the session runtime that wires, spawns, and
  supervises a manifest set, and the boot path — plus the `broker` binary
  itself, the desktop's root process (§5.1, §5.3, §5.5); see In flight.
  No `unsafe`.
- `sys/freebsd-{capsicum,jail,procdesc,libcasper}-sys` — the FreeBSD FFI
  crates (§6), all four now built out and VM-verified. Capsicum and
  procdesc carry C shims (Capsicum's rights API is C macros; procdesc's
  `pdfork`-then-`exec` must run in C); jail and libcasper are direct
  `extern` blocks. Each is gated on `target_os = "freebsd"` and compiles
  to an empty library on macOS.

The workspace is thirteen `crates/` + four `sys/` + `xtask`, `cargo
xtask ci` green on macOS and FreeBSD.

## Site

`site/` is the project's static web presentation — seven pages: a landing
page, the vision and principles, the architecture, the component map, the
interface contracts, the ecosystem stance, and the five-milestone roadmap,
plus shared styling (`style.css`). It tracks `DESIGN.md` and is updated as
the design moves — last refreshed alongside the window-management,
screen-capture, and capability-coverage design work (`9fb7995`). It is a
presentation layer, deliberately outside the Cargo workspace.

## In flight

**Phase 4's FreeBSD remainder is in progress** — `crates/abyss-transport`
is the FreeBSD IPC and event substrate (`broker-and-transport.md` §2):

- `Channel` — a `SOCK_SEQPACKET` socket pair with `SCM_RIGHTS` fd-passing
  over a C cmsg shim;
- `MessageChannel` — a bare envelope per datagram (the bootstrap bundle);
- `RingFrame` / `FramedChannel` — the IPC ring's wire (§2.6): an 8-byte
  ring frame, with the correlation id, ahead of each envelope;
- `Reactor` / `ReactorSource` — the `kqueue` readiness reactor (§2.3),
  presented as an `abyss-looper` `EventSource`: a looper built on it is
  driven by the `kqueue` where the in-process backend used thread-park;
- `AsyncChannel` — a `FramedChannel` whose `recv`/`send` suspend the
  *task*, not the looper thread, when the socket would block;
- `Connection` — the request/reply protocol (§2.7): `call` correlates a
  request with its reply by id; `send` carries a one-way Command or Event;
  `serve` routes replies to callers and inbound messages to an `Inbox`;
  `accept` lifts a request off it with a `Responder`. **The IPC ring is
  complete.**

A design pass first settled where this was under-specified — the Gate D
doc gained §2.5–§2.7 (`Interface::Message: Wire`; the IPC ring frame; the
`Responder`) — and `abyss-looper` gained the **`EventSource` seam** so a
non-thread-park backend can drive the looper (looper-framework §3.3).
Verified end to end in the FreeBSD VM: a looper `call`s and gets a
correlated reply, and an `accept`ed request is answered through its
`Responder`.

The broker's jailed-spawn foundation is also down: **`freebsd-procdesc-sys`**
is reworked from blind scaffold to a real, VM-verified `spawn` — `pdfork`
then `execve`, done in a C shim so no Rust runs in the forked child, with
a `Child` holding the process descriptor that `wait`s on the exit and
`kill`s the child (§5.3, §5.5); and **`freebsd-jail-sys`** is verified, the
spawned child `jail_attach`ing before the exec so a component lands
confined; and the spawn hands the child a bootstrap socket at fd 3.
**`abyss-broker`'s `spawn` module** composes all of it: `spawn_component`
creates the component's jail, opens the bootstrap channel, `pdfork`s the
program into the jail holding that channel as fd 3, and sends the
bootstrap bundle over it.

And the spawn-and-bootstrap loop is closed. **`abyss-bootstrap`** is the
component-side startup shim: `enter` adopts the bootstrap socket at fd 3,
receives the bundle, and `cap_enter`s — verifying `freebsd-capsicum-sys`.
The `component-probe` binary is the first AbyssBSD component; an
end-to-end VM test spawns it through the broker and sees it report back
from inside capability mode, having received exactly the bundle the
broker sent. And the kqueue substrate now watches process descriptors for
exit (`EVFILT_PROCDESC` / `NOTE_EXIT`); the broker's **process
supervision** is built on that signal — it watches its components'
process descriptors and, when one exits, spawns it again, reclaiming its
jail first. Verified in the VM: a supervised component that exits is
respawned as a fresh process. And `Cap: Wire` is under way — `abyss-cap`'s **`CapBody`** is the §3.2
handle-table body a capability serializes to (the `cap_rights` mask and
the object-rights set that ride beside an fd), and `abyss-msg`'s handle
table now **carries those fds**: `HandleSink` / `HandleStore` pair each
handle's metadata with the descriptor it rides `SCM_RIGHTS` on, and
`Envelope::from_message` / `into_message` carry the fds across. Two design
passes have pinned what the IPC backend lands in: §2.8 — the `Cap`
two-backend crate structure (`abyss-cap` over `abyss-transport`, `Cap:
Wire` gated to FreeBSD); §2.9 — the interface contract `Cap::send`/`call`
dispatch through, its shape checked against the Wayland / FIDL / Cap'n
Proto / Binder corpus. That contract layer is built:
`abyss-msg`'s **`Method`** trait and **`#[derive(Method)]`** give a
message its routing identity — the method ordinal (by declaration order)
and the kind — and `abyss-cap`'s **`Interface::ID`** gives the interface
its id; together they name an envelope `Header`. `Connection::send`
carries a one-way Command or Event, the IPC counterpart of `call`. And
the **`Cap` rework** is under way — `Cap<I, R>` holds a `Backend`, both
variants now in: `Local` (the in-process ring) and `Ipc` (an
`abyss-transport` `Connection`). `Cap::send` dispatches over either;
sent over IPC, a message is framed with its interface and method identity
and crosses a real `SOCK_SEQPACKET` ring. A further design pass (§2.10)
pinned the typed request/reply shape `Cap::call` reshapes to — precise
per-request, each request its own type carrying its reply type, the
gRPC / FIDL shape — and that layer's trait and derive are built:
`abyss-msg`'s **`Request`** (`type Reply`) and **`#[derive(Request)]`**,
which links each request payload to its message enum and to its reply
type. The `Cap::call` reshape (§2.7, §2.10) is **done**. `abyss-looper` gained
the in-process reply path — the **`Responder`** handle, and `Delivery` /
`Ctx` / `Looper::attach_service` carrying a request's responder to its
handler — and `Cap::call` is reshaped onto it: `call<Q>` hands the caller
exactly the request's `Q::Reply`, framework-mediated over either backend,
no embedded `Sender`. The multi-looper harness passes on the reshaped
path. A design pass (§3.5) pinned `Cap: Wire`'s mechanics, and **`Cap: Wire` is
now built**. `abyss-looper` first gained a **`Spawner`** — a cloneable,
`Send` handle that adds tasks to a running looper (looper-framework §10),
drained and installed at the start of every run turn. Then `abyss-cap`'s
**`impl Wire for Cap`**: `to_wire` duplicates the cap's ring socket onto
`SCM_RIGHTS` beside its `CapBody`; `from_wire` yields an *unbound* `Cap` —
a received fd, no live ring; and **`Cap::bind`** lifts that into a live
`Connection` on the looper's reactor and spawns its `serve` loop through
the `Spawner` — the single `IpcUnbound → Ipc` edge. The transport gained
the supporting API: `AsFd` for `Connection` / `AsyncChannel`,
`FramedChannel::from_fd`, and a non-blocking `Connection::try_send` that
wires `Cap::try_send`'s IPC arm. Verified in the VM: a `Cap` round-trips
through `to_wire` / `from_wire` across a socket, binds onto a looper, and
`call`s over the bound ring with the reply routed by the spawned `serve`
loop.

The broker now **wires an authority graph into a spawned session** (§5.2).
A design pass pinned the **bootstrap-bundle schema** (§5.8) — the payload
format §5.3 left open — and the new **`abyss-bundle`** crate *is* that
schema: `Bundle`, a `Wire`-round-tripping list of capability `Grant`s,
each an `interface`, a `Role` (client / server), a `CapBody`, and a
ring-endpoint descriptor; the contract the broker and every startup shim
share. On it, `abyss-broker`'s new **`session`** module turns a `Graph`
into a running set: `Session::wire` pre-creates a `SOCK_SEQPACKET` ring
per connection and assembles each component's `Bundle` (requester ↦
client end, provider ↦ server end), `Session::spawn` brings each
component into being holding it. Verified in the VM: a three-component
graph is wired and spawned, and each component decodes its bundle and
finds exactly the grants its connections imply. The minted capabilities
carry zero rights for now (`TECH-DEBT.md`) — but the model they will be
minted from is no longer open: a first-principles design pass, grounded in
Capsicum / seL4 / Cap'n Proto / Fuchsia / Wayland, **pinned the
object-rights model in §3.3**. A service ring is a multiplexor, so object
rights are a bitmask over an interface's method ordinals (the unit
`#[derive(Method)]` already assigns), service-enforced — the kernel
`cap_rights_t` mask's counterpart one layer up. §3.3 rewritten end to end;
the kernel-layer table corrected (the service-ring mask gains `CAP_FCNTL`).

Three correctness defects in **`abyss-looper`** were then found and fixed,
each with a regression test: a **lost wakeup** in the ring — a send
cancelled while pending stranded its waker ahead of a live sender's, so a
freed slot woke no one; a **responder leak** — `attach_service` held an
unanswered request's responder past the handler, leaving its caller to
hang; and **unbounded task-arena growth** — a completed task's slot was
never reclaimed, now a generational slotmap that frees and reuses slots.

And the **startup shim brings the bundle to life** (§5.4).
`abyss-bootstrap`'s `enter` decodes the received envelope into a `Bundle`;
`Startup` claims each grant — a `client` grant as an unbound `Cap<I, R>`
(`abyss-cap::unbound_ipc_cap`), a `server` grant as the service end of its
ring. A component then builds its looper, binds a claimed `Cap` to it
(§3.5), and uses it. **Two components now converse over a broker-wired
ring**: the end-to-end test wires a three-component session and spawns it,
and the `compositor` probe `call`s a request over the ring to the `input`
probe, which serves it and replies — a request and its reply crossing a
`SOCK_SEQPACKET` ring between two jailed, capability-mode components the
broker spawned and wired. This reaches the bulk of **M1**.

The first of §3.3's two rights layers is now enforced: `Session::wire`
builds the fixed service-ring `cap_rights_t` mask (`CAP_SEND`, `CAP_RECV`,
`CAP_EVENT`, `CAP_FCNTL`, `CAP_FSTAT`), `cap_rights_limit`s each ring
descriptor to it, and records it in the grant's `CapBody`;
`freebsd-capsicum-sys` gained `CAP_FCNTL`. The conversation still runs end
to end over the now-restricted rings — proof the mask covers what the
transport exercises.

The **§3.3 object-rights layer is built and enforced end to end**, and
with it §3.6, the IPC service framework. A message enum's command and
request variants are tagged `#[rights(name)]`, and `#[derive(Method)]`
collects the tags into `Method::RIGHTS_CLASSES`. The broker's `catalogue`
module resolves a manifest's `rights` tokens to an `object_rights` mask,
and `Session::wire` mints it into both grants. `abyss-transport`'s ring
frame gained an **`Error`** kind; `abyss-cap` gained **`bind_service`**,
the server counterpart of `Cap::bind` — it binds a `Role::Server` grant,
runs an accept loop that **checks each inbound `method_id` against the
object-rights mask before a `Service` handler sees the message**, and
refuses what is out of rights; `Cap::call` yields a `CallError`. A wired
test grants a component no rights on a peer, and its `call` is refused —
the broker's mint, the framework's check, the `Error` frame, and
`CallError::RightsDenied` at the caller, across two jailed,
capability-mode components.

A design pass (§5.5) has pinned **`PeerRestarted`** — the broker re-wiring
a restarted component's peers: the bootstrap channel kept as a *control
connection*, a `PeerRestarted` message carrying one fresh `Grant`, the
`Session` and `Supervisor` unified into one broker runtime, and the
component-side **durable capability** the framework repoints at the fresh
ring so a `call` after a restart travels it transparently. Building it has
begun: `abyss-bundle` gained the **`PeerRestarted`** control message — one
fresh `Grant` — and `abyss-cap` gained the **durable capability**:
`DurableCap` carries the `Cap` in use, and a paired `Repointer` swaps it
for a fresh ring, so a `call` after a restart travels the new ring. And
**`Session` and `Supervisor` are now one runtime**: `supervisor.rs` is
gone, its restart-on-exit logic folded into the `session` module.
`Session::launch` wires, spawns, and registers every component's process
descriptor on a kqueue reactor; `Session::step` supervises — and on a
component exit it *re-wires*, creating a fresh ring per connection the
dead component touched, respawning it into a fresh bundle, and sending
each surviving peer a `PeerRestarted` over that peer's control channel.
Verified in the VM: a component that exits is re-wired and restarted, its
live peer untouched. And the component side is built: `abyss-transport`
gained **`AsyncMessageChannel`**, the bare-envelope async sibling of
`AsyncChannel` — a component wraps its bootstrap channel in one to await
`PeerRestarted` without blocking its looper thread — and `abyss-bootstrap`
gained **`Control`**, the component's control loop. It watches that
channel, decodes each `PeerRestarted`, and routes the fresh `Grant` to a
per-interface rewire handler; `Control::durable_cap` makes a bound client
`Cap` a `DurableCap`, registers the rewiring, and hands back a `Receiver`
that ticks on each repoint, so a component can await its peer being
re-wired before calling again. And **§5.5 is proven end to end**: a wired
test launches a client/server probe pair, lets the server answer one call
and exit, `step`s the broker to re-wire and respawn it — and the client's
*second* call, over the durable capability the control loop repointed,
reaches the freshly restarted server. The broker re-wires a dead peer and
the call after it still lands.

With §5.5 closed, the broker's own boot path is **built — the broker is
now a program**. **`Manifest::load_dir`** reads the manifest set from a
directory (§5.1), in file-name order so the authority graph is
deterministic. The **interface catalogue** now has a settled on-disk
form: the broker links no component code, so the rights classes reach it
as data — **`InterfaceCatalogue::load`** parses a declarative catalogue
file, the on-disk counterpart of the manifests, each `[interface]` block
listing a rights class as the method ordinals it covers. That pins the
design's open question (§3.3 updated). On those two, **`abyss_broker::
boot`** is the boot path — load the manifests and catalogue, build the
graph, launch the session — and **`src/bin/broker.rs`** is the broker
proper: the desktop's root process, a thin shell that boots a session and
drives `Session::step` in a loop for its life, logging each restart. A
wired test boots a three-component session entirely from files on disk
and sees the components converse.

And supervision now honours the manifest's **restart policy**: `step`
consults each exited component's `always` / `on-failure` / `never` policy
— `on-failure` reading the exit status the kqueue reactor's
`ProcessExited` event now carries — and a component the policy does not
restart is stopped, its jail reclaimed and its peers' rings left closed
(§5.5).

And **§5.6 delegated spawn is proven end to end**. A `kind = spawn`
component asks the broker to launch a named app from the spawnable set
over its control connection; the broker checks the capability, looks up
the manifest, validates the child's authority against the running
session, wires its connections to live peers, spawns it into the session,
joins it to the graph and the supervised set, sends each peer a
`PeerRestarted`, and replies `Spawned`. A wired test runs the dance: a
spawn-capable requester probe gets `Spawned` back and exits 0, the named
child joins the session. Five bricks supported the handler — the
**`kind = spawn`** capability, the **`SpawnChild` / `SpawnReply`** control
messages in the `abyss-bundle` schema crate, the **spawnable manifest
set** (`SpawnableSet`), the **bidirectional control connection**
(`Session::step` watching every control channel on the `kqueue`), and the
**runtime support** the handler needed (a growable authority graph and
spawn programs pre-resolved for every spawnable manifest). `rewire`'s
body is now the shared `wire_connections` — restart and delegated spawn
read from the same wire. Refusals (no `spawn` capability, unknown
manifest, name collision, unresolvable authority, spawn failure) all
return a `Refused` with a reason and leave the session untouched; only a
full success mutates.

And the last Phase 4 design point is now **built**: **the `Cap<I, R>`
typestate is connected to the runtime mask** (§3.3). The `Rights` trait
carries `const MASK: u32`; every `Cap` holds the runtime mask (the
`Local` backend in a new field, the IPC backends in their `CapBody`),
set at construction to `R::MASK`. `narrow::<R2>` ANDs the carried mask
with `R2::MASK` — recursive attenuation, never amplification —
type-narrowing and the runtime mask now move together. `bind` rejects,
at the seam, a `Cap` whose arrived `object_rights` is wider than the
receiving `R::MASK`: a contract violation, panicking like `bind`'s
existing misuse panics. A `Cap::mask()` accessor exposes the carried
mask; the harness asserts `narrow` ANDs it (`Full` → `ReadOnly` →
`ReadOnly::MASK`). `R` is interface-agnostic in this pass; the
associated-type tightening is noted in §3.3 for later.

And **§5.7 Casper is built**: the design pinned it, then four bricks
landed it. **`abyss-bundle` carries Casper channels** alongside peer
grants (`Bundle.casper_channels: Vec<CasperChannel>`, distinct handle
kind, the wire form round-trips both lists); the **startup shim claims
them** (`Startup::casper_channels` / `take_casper_channel`, symmetric
with the grant-claim API); the broker's **libcasper FFI** is in
(`sys/freebsd-libcasper-sys`'s `CapChannel`, `cap_init` /
`cap_service_open` / `cap_close` / `cap_sock`); and the broker's
**wire-time open** is wired — `Session::launch`'s `wire_bundles` opens a
`CapChannel` per declared `kind = casper` capability and populates each
component's bundle, lazily initialising the broker's root channel to
`casperd` on first use. A wired error-path test proves the wiring: a
manifest naming a Casper service libcasper does not know fails the
launch with `SessionError::Io`. The full success-path end-to-end (a
component actually doing a DNS lookup over its channel) wants the
broker linked against a service library such as `libcap_dns` — worth a
focused follow-up. `cargo xtask ci` green on macOS and FreeBSD; tree
clean.

## Next

**Phase 4 is closed.** Gate D's broker-and-transport work — the manifest
parser and authority graph; the interface catalogue; the FreeBSD IPC
transport (`Channel` / `MessageChannel` / `FramedChannel`,
request/reply `Connection`, the kqueue `Reactor` / `ReactorSource` /
`AsyncChannel` / `AsyncMessageChannel`); the broker (manifest set,
catalogue, spawnable set, `Session` wiring + supervision; the boot
binary; restart policies; delegated spawn end to end; Casper) — is built
and proven in the VM.

Focused follow-ups, none blocking the next phase:

- **Casper success-path e2e** — link the broker against `libcap_dns`
  (or another service library), wire a probe component that does a real
  DNS lookup over its channel. Pins the §5.7 round-trip in a wired test.
- **Delegated-spawn casper and restart-casper** — a delegated child
  with `kind = casper` caps; a restarted component's Casper channels
  re-opened. Both reuse the `casper_root` the `Session` already keeps.
- **`Cap<I, R>`'s associated-type tightening** — tie `R` to its `I` so
  `input::Recv` cannot be used with `Cap<Display, _>` (§3.3).

Phase 5 (the desktop layer — compositor, input, the toolkit's first
wired components) is what's next on the roadmap. See `ROADMAP.md`.
